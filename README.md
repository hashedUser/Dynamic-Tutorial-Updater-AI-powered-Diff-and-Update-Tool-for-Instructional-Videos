# FreshKnowledge a Dynamic-Tutorial-Updater

**FreshKnowledge** is a concept for an AI-powered tool that helps learners follow older instructional videos by automatically detecting where content is outdated and providing updated explanations. The idea is to make sure that even if a tutorial was created years ago, people can still use it confidently with the most current knowledge.

## 📌 What it does

- Takes a YouTube tutorial (or any instructional video)
- Converts the audio to text (transcript)
- Uses AI to compare the tutorial’s content with current best practices, tools, or APIs
- Highlights what has changed
- Provides updated instructions or explanations to help the viewer follow along

---

## 🌟 Why this is useful

✅ Helps people avoid confusion when tutorials contain outdated steps  
✅ Saves time by automatically showing what has changed  
✅ Makes learning more efficient, especially in fast-changing fields like coding, data science, or software use  
✅ Extends the usefulness of existing video tutorials without needing to re-record them

## 🚀 How it could work (future vision)

1️⃣ Input a video URL or upload a file  
2️⃣ The tool transcribes the audio  
3️⃣ AI analyzes the steps and instructions  
4️⃣ The tool checks for changes in methods, tools, or APIs  
5️⃣ A clear report is generated showing updates and differences

## 🛠 Status

👉 This is currently an idea and concept draft.  
👉 The goal is to build a basic prototype that can:
- Extract a transcript from a video
- Compare it to updated information
- Provide clear difference explanations
